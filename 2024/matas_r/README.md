# aoc with Kotlin

## How to run
Execute files to run according day's task. .main.kts extension is required for `kotlin [filename]` to work, coz this language is horrible and has no simple way to run standalone files without all the bloatware and IDE's.

```bash
kotlin -version       
Kotlin version 2.1.0-release-394 (JRE 21.0.3+-79915917-b509.11)
kotlin Day1_part1.main.kts
```

Also, edit files in Android Studio or other JetBrains IDE, since other's have limited support, coz Corporations..
